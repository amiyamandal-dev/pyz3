# User Guide

The user guide details every single feature pyZ3 offers. All code snippets are taken
from our `example/` directory and are tested during CI.

If you do struggle or find any issues with the examples, please do [let us know!](https://github.com/fulcrum-so/pyZ3/issues)

## Conventions

pyZ3 maintains a consistent set of conventions around structs, function naming, and memory
management to assist with development.

### Passing root type

pyZ3 requires access to your top-level zig module.  As a convention, we recommend assigning
zig's [`@This`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#This) to a global variable named
`root` which you need to pass to many pyZ3 functions.

### Conversion Functions

When converting from Python to Zig types:

* `.as(root, T, anytype)` - return a view of the object *as* the given type. This will leave the `refcnt` of the original object untouched.

When creating Python types from Zig types:

* `.create(root, anytype)` - create a new Python object from a Zig type. Zig slices are copied.
* `PyFoo(root).from.checked(root, py.PyObject)` - checks a `PyObject` is indeed a `PyFoo` before wrapping it up as one.
* `PyFoo(root).from.unchecked(py.PyObject)` - wraps a `PyObject` as a `PyFoo` without checking the type.

## Type Conversions

At comptime, pyZ3 wraps your function definitions such that native Zig types can be accepted
or returned from functions and automatically converted into Python objects.

### Zig Primitives

| Zig Type              | Python Type  |
|:----------------------| :----------- |
| `void`                | `None`       |
| `bool`                | `bool`       |
| `i32`, `i64`          | `int`        |
| `u32`, `u64`          | `int`        |
| `f16`, `f32`, `f64`   | `float`      |
| `struct`              | `dict`       |
| `tuple struct`        | `tuple`      |
| `[]const u8`          | `str`        |
| `*[_]u8`              | `str`        |

!!! tip ""

    Slices (e.g. `[]const u8` strings) cannot be returned from pyZ3 functions since pyZ3 has
    no way to deallocate them after they're copied into Python.

    Slices _can_ be taken as arguments to a function, but the bytes underlying that slice are only
    guaranteed to live for the duration of the function call. They should be copied if you wish to extend
    the lifetime.

### pyZ3 Objects

Pointers to any pyZ3 Zig structs will convert to their corresponding Python instance.

For example, given the class `Foo` below,
if the class is initialized with `const foo: *Foo = py.init(Foo, .{})`,
then a result of `foo` will be wrapped into the corresponding Python instance of
`Foo`.

```zig title="foo.zig"
const Foo = py.class(struct { a: u32 = 0 });

pub fn create_foo() *const Foo {
    return py.init(Foo, .{});
}
```

### pyZ3 Type Wrappers

The pyZ3 Python type wrappers convert as expected. Note that `root` must be passed as a compile-time parameter to container type wrappers
(like `PyList(root)`, `PyDict(root)`, etc.), but not to simple types like `PyString` or `PyInt`.

| Zig Type           | Python Type      |
| :----------------- | :--------------- |
| `py.PyObject`      | `object`         |
| `py.PyBool`        | `bool`           |
| `py.PyBytes`       | `bytes`          |
| `py.PyLong`        | `int`            |
| `py.PyFloat`       | `float`          |
| `py.PyString`      | `str`            |
| `py.PyList(root)`  | `list`           |
| `py.PyTuple(root)` | `tuple`          |
| `py.PyFrame(root)` | `frame`          |
| `py.PyDict(root)`  | `dict`           |
| `py.PySlice(root)` | `slice`          |
| `py.PyArray(root)` | `numpy.ndarray`  |
